          <ul>
            <li>History of computer graphics</li>
            <li>Brief survey of computer graphics applications and technologies</li>
            <li>Basic math behind computer graphics operations</li>

          <h2>What Are Computer Graphics?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Computer graphics deals with images. The images are moved around. Their scale is changed.
            Three dimensions are projected onto two dimensions. All the main operations are done by
            matrices.

          <h2>History of Graphics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2D graphics: really more suited for an art history class</li>
            <li>3D graphics: started in the 1960s.</li>
            <li>Ivan Sutherland
              <ul>
                <li>Developed computer program called SKETCHPAD, one of the first 2D CAD programs</li>
                <li>Came up with 10 problems in computer graphics - most have been solved at least partially by now (but others came up with more!)</li>
              </ul></li>
            <li>1970s: Saw first use in movies (wireframe)</li>
            <li>1980s: Real time graphics hardware mainstream for 2d games and computer animation</li>
            <li>1990s: First real time 3D graphics hardware and software started appearing. Standardized libraries started appearing (like DirectX and OpenGL). First computer animated feature length film released (Toy Story)</li>
            <li>2000s: 3D graphics hardware and software becomes regularly used. Many innovations improve performance and ease of use.</li>
            <li>2010s: Virtual reality hardware becomes mainstream, which allows users to navigate a 3D space much more intuitively.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Example Uses for 3D Graphics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Animation</li>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>CAD</li>
            <li>Simulation and modeling</li>

          <h2>How Does This Relate?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Almost all computers display on a two dimensional screen.</li>
            <li>For 3D graphics, this means we need to project a 3D scene onto a "viewport."</li>
